# :nose: :rat: Sneezing Rat :rat: :nose:

## Description
One of my first personal projects made in my High School AP Computer Science class alongside my friend, Brayden Vassilas. A very simple, very short game made with Java and the Java GUI.  While we wanted to include more into the game to improve the game's mechanics and and graphics, it's been fun to play the simple game as it is and remember the class that first introduced me to Computer Science.
## How to Play
Run the GameStart.java file to run the game.  You will see a small square (the "rat") on the bottom of which you can move left and right, two yellow walls, and a big rectangle (representing the enemy) on the top of the screen.  Multicolored blocks ("acorns") will start to fall at varying speeds as you try to avoid them.

To move left and right, use the left arrow and right arrow keys.  The game will end once you get hit by an acorn.  While it may not seem like it, this rat has a special power.  When it "sneezes", the rat can teleport to any x-axis location on the game board!  This means that when you are about to be hit by a falling acorn, you may "sneeze" to avoid it by hitting the down arrow key.
